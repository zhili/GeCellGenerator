Basicly, it is the same thing as the previous project gMapAndExcel.
However, i have make some nice improvement to it. It is now use a excel template
file as the main information source. And it can only be run at Windows, with 
simple UI. You can set the line's color and the sector's radius in the template
file. That's all:)
